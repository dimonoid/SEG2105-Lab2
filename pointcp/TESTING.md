# Your discussion about testing

This is where you should provide a description in
[GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
that clearly describes:

* how you did the tests,
* sample outputs from running the tests
* the table and
* a discussion of the results.


# Tests
* I created files TestEverything and Collections.
TestEverything was used to both measure speed and test the implementations of all 3  designs for correctness of the outputs.

* Sample:
```javas
PointCP('C'): 
Design 0 (max: 8718.227ns, median: 32.821ns, min: 14.222ns)
Design 2 (max: 7301.474ns, median: 125.63ns, min: 69.288ns)
Design 3 (max: 2826.577ns, median: 31.362ns, min: 18.963ns)
Design 6 (max: 2572.836ns, median: 30.583ns, min: 20.584ns)
```

* I worked myself without a partner, and got decent results for futher analysis. Design 6 appeared to have the same speed as the corresponding implementations.
